# Reflection and Journalling

Why Reflect?

Reflection helps consolidate learning made over a period of time.

Reflecting consistently and regularly seems best. 
This would allow for a habit to be built and adhered to.
Reflecting could be considered a skill.
Therefore a habit would help improve this skill.


Reflection Methods

- Journaling (this document)
- Blog writing (like Medium)
- Class discussions both in person and online


# Your Brain

Neuroplasticity

Classical conditioning in neuroscience is the idea that neurons that fire together wire together. (See: Pavlovs dog.) The suggestion is that brains develop and cannot be rewired thereafter.

Neuroplasticity is essentially the idea that minds can be changed. 

Research in this area has implications for brain disorders and also for learning.
One study of New York taxi drivers found that parts of a taxi drivers brain associated with spacial memory were larger than an average. This could demonstrate how the way we use our brains leads to changes to the brain, and suggests that developing new skills may take time as the brain physically rewires or develops.

Huberman states:
The real change to the brain occurs as a result of deliberate focus.
Deep sleep is when learning is committed to long-term memory.
Word-less activities like going for a walk are good activities to follow your periods of learning.
There are times of the day where you may concentrate better - capitalise on them.
Make a deliberate effort to focus over increasingly long periods of time up to 90 mins.
Don't expect to be focussed at all times.

Growth Mindset

The act of beliving you can improve, increases the likelihood and degree to which you improve.
