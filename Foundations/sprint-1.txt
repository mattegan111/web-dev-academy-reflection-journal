# Command line

-How would you describe the command line in plain English in a couple of sentences? 
Can you think of an analogy for it?

The command line is a way of entering instructions into a computer.
In theory, a CLI could be used in place of most GUI interactions, if a program was designed as such.
Unlike a GUI, we type commands into a CLI and receive an output, and/or changes are made which are not seen to us.

-Did you learn anything unexpected?

Top tip for cli: use [tab] key to autocomplete what you're typing.
Very useful when typing directories.
